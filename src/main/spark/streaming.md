### Discretized Streams (DStreams) ###

    -   DStream is the basic abstraction provided by Spark Streaming. It represents a continuous stream of data, 
        either the input data stream received from source, or the processed data stream generated by transforming the input stream. 
        Internally, a DStream is represented by a continuous series of RDDs, which is Sparkâ€™s abstraction of an immutable.

    -   Transfers in streaming : countByValue, reduce, 
    -   updateStateByKey: Return a new "state" DStream where the state for each key is updated by applying the given function on the previous state of the key and the new values for the key. This can be used to maintain arbitrary state data for each key. updateStateByKey requires the checkpoint directory to be configured,
        transform: The transform operation (along with its variations like transformWith) allows arbitrary RDD-to-RDD functions to be applied on a DStream.
                window length - The duration of the window, sliding interval - The interval at which the window operation is performed.

    At most once: Each record will be either processed once or not processed at all.
    At least once: Each record will be processed one or more times. This is stronger than at-most once as it ensure that no data will be lost. But there may be duplicates.
    Exactly once: Each record will be processed exactly once - no data will be lost and no data will be processed multiple times. This is obviously the strongest guarantee of the three
